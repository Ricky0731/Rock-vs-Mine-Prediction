# 🪨 Rock vs Mine Prediction 🚢

Welcome to the **Rock vs Mine Prediction** project! This repository contains code and resources for predicting whether an object is a rock or a mine using machine learning.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify objects as either rocks or mines based on their sonar signals. This prediction model can be particularly useful in underwater explorations and mining operations.

### 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a machine learning model to classify objects using sonar signals.
- Achieve high accuracy and reliability in predictions.
- Provide an easy-to-use interface for deploying the model.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### 📋 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Pip (Python package manager)

### 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-vs-mine-prediction.git
cd rock-vs-mine-prediction
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Data

The dataset consists of sonar signals bounced off metal cylinders (mines) and roughly cylindrical rocks. Each observation has 60 attributes, representing energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time.

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Development**: Using various machine learning algorithms to build the classification model.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### 🧪 Example Usage

Here’s a simple example to classify a new sonar signal:

```python
from src.predict import predict_object

# Example sonar signal data
sonar_signal = [0.02, 0.03, 0.04, ..., 0.05]

# Predicting the object
result = predict_object(sonar_signal)
print(f'The object is a: {result}')
```

## 🤖 Models Used

- **Logistic Regression**

## 📈 Results

Our best model achieved an accuracy of **85%** on the test set.
